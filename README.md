* **Dual Panels:** Separate, dedicated interfaces for Admins and Salespersons.
* **Multi-Session Handling:** Run Admin and Sales sessions concurrently in the same browser without state collision.
* **Role-Based Route Guarding:** Secure frontend routes to prevent unauthorized panel access.
* **Product Management:** Complete CRUD operations for the inventory.
* **Salesperson Management:** Complete CRUD operations for staff records.
* **Point of Sale (POS):** Fast checkout interface with product search and autocomplete features.
* **Sales Records:** Log, view, and audit past transactions.
* **Receipt Generation:** Print or save structured digital purchase receipts.
* **Notifications:** Sweet Alert Notifications.
* **Security & Validation:** Secure REST API integration, robust frontend form validation via React Hook Form, and backend role validation.
* **UX Enrichments:** Responsive Bootstrap UI, dark mode toggle, and SweetAlert2 notifications.

## Upgarded Features

### Multi-Session Role Authentication System

### 1. Dual-Session Storage Prefixing
* **Admin Session:** Stored under admin_token
* **Sales Session:** Stored under sales_token

### 2. Isolated Logout Logic

* Clicking **Logout** on the Salesperson dashboard clears only sales_token.
* The admin_token remains intact, preserving the administrator's active session in other tabs.

### 3. Strict Role-Based Route Guarding

* **Targeted Token Check:** Accessing /admin/* routes strictly validates the existence and integrity of admin_token.
* **Contextual Redirection:** If a user with an active sales_token attempts to access an administrative link, the guard intercepts the request and redirects them to the /admin/login prompt rather than exposing the dashboard.

### Route Guard Pseudo-Logic

### Alternative Testing Strategies

* **Incognito/Private Windows:** Open the salesperson dashboard in a private window to create a separate cookie jar.
* **Cross-Browser Testing:** Use separate browser engines (e.g., Google Chrome for Admin tasks and Mozilla Firefox for Sales tasks).
